Approaches tried:

1. Debug the issue found like it's happening thru SLF4J 
2. Tried to Escape Logging, later found it's happening while preparing JSON Response (Tried various permutations and combinations of JSON annotations)
3. Tried to Keep VO Object which could be intermediate between Actual Clinic From DB and The Response being sent (supports to only parent clinics doesn't work)
4. Tried to turn off AOP pointcut for the specific flow
5. Tried to turn on OpenInView Filter in Application.yml -> it wasn't connecting to Dev DB itself,Server hangs @ executing the Liquibase step.
6. Tried adding @Proxy(lazy=false) to User and Clinic classes -- No effect
7. Tried @PersistenceContext(type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED) Added on DatabaseConfiguration.java -> No effect
8. Assuming that there is only one change between DEV Profile and an other Profile , did the change required in LoggingAspect.java but of no effect.
9. Tried various combination of JSON Annotations but didn't work.(Added @JsonIgnore on clinics of User class, @JsonIgnore on childClinics,users and @JsonIdentifyInfo on clinic with Object processor id on Clinic class) 
10.Tried FetchType = EAGER was breaking with XAuthTokenFilter with an Exception: Can't assign Long to com.hillrom.vest.domain.User (Couldn't debug properly due to fitering flow)

I might have missed any silly thing while trying these approaches or there could be a simple fix to resolve this which i didn't figure out.

It could be of great help if any of you could fix the issue.
